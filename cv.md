## Summary

I study JavaScript at the Rolling Scopes School and would like to start a career in this area. I completed my studies at The Academy of Public Administration under the aegis of the President of the Republic of Belarus in Minsk, Belarus in 2008. I currently work as a Labor and Wages Economist at the Sports and Tourism Education Department in Dzerzhinsk, Belarus. I perceive myself as a fast-learner able to take initiative and work independently, but also as an effective team player. I believe I can offer your organization professional commitment and support.
